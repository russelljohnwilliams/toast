My PhD in part explores the continuum between the writings and drawings Judith Kerr made as a child in exile and the adult retelling of this experience in When Hitler Stole Pink Rabbit. (Judith Kerr wrote and illustrated the poems Anna alludes to at the beginning of the novel.). Further to the BBC documentary Carina recommends which can be viewed in full on YouTube, I would guide readers to the digital exhibition on the Seven Stories website, where you can view some of young Judith Kerr&#39;s artworks (http://sevenstoriesexhibition.cfpreview.co.uk/3/exhibition) And do read on! When Hitler Stole Pink Rabbit is followed by two novels that continue Anna&#39;s story - Bombs on Aunt Dainty and A Small Person Far Away.</p>",

Last summer I wrote my first ever &#34;fan letter&#34; - it was to Judith Kerr in part to thank her for this story - that shaped me so much as a young reader. I feel the time when there will be no one alive with direct experience of the events of the Second World War is coming so soon and this change is already shaping politics and perceptions of how people treat people. So many reasons to keep this book in school libraries, gift to children and reread and read as adults!</p><p></p>",

    "comment": "<p>As a secondary school librarian I am always delighted to hear of adults who read books written for children or young people, and then share them with other adults. There are so many fabulous books available for young people and it makes me so sad that they go largely unappreciated by adults who consider them inappropriate for their own consumption, and are content to think of David Williams’ books and Diary of a Wimpy Kid as good examples of popular writing for children.</p><p>Authors like Judith Kerr who write about their own experiences of events such as WW2 will, as someone rightly remarked, soon not be around any longer. We should read, explore and share books like this with the younger generation so they will perhaps understand something of what victims of war have to live with. There are many other YA (young adult) books about war and its consequences (The Book Thief by Markus Zusak is an excellent example, and a favourite book of mine) and if it were up to me I would ensure that everyone read a copy of Anne Frank’s Diary of a Young Girl.</p><p>Thank you, Jen, for bringing the wonderful When Hitler Stole Pink Rabbit to more people’s attention, and if you have been encouraged to pick it up and read it, please carry on reading some more of the brilliant authors we have who are writing for our upcoming generations.</p>",
